# Messaging PoC

This package aims to be a drop-in replacement of
[fedora-messaging](https://fedora-messaging.readthedocs.io/) for connecting to an AMQP 1.0 broker.
This package tries to provide the same high-level API as fedora-messaging for common use-cases.

This is currently in a pre-alpha phase, and the project will be eventually renamed
if it goes beyond a proof of concept.

## To Do

* Add support for custom Message classes with schemas
* Add the publishing APIs and publishing signals
* Add a CLI
* Write unit tests
